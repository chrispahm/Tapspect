# Privacy Policy

**Tapspect**
Last updated: February 21, 2026

## Overview

Tapspect is a developer tool that runs entirely on your device. We do not operate any servers, and the app does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data with us.

## Data That Stays on Your Device

- **URLs you visit** are stored locally in the app to remember your last session.
- **Console logs and network requests** captured by the debug panel exist only in memory and are discarded when you close the app.
- **Screenshots** are saved to the app's local storage on your device.

## Optional Screenshot Upload

Tapspect includes an optional screenshot upload feature that is **disabled by default**. If you choose to enable it, you configure your own upload server URL and credentials. When enabled:

- Screenshots are sent directly from your device to the server URL you specify. Tapspect does not route, proxy, or intercept this traffic.
- Authentication credentials you provide are stored in the iOS Keychain on your device and are only sent to the server you configured.
- We have no access to your screenshots, your server, or your credentials.

## Third-Party Services

Tapspect does not include any analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs. The app makes no network requests other than:

1. Loading the web page URL you enter.
2. Uploading screenshots to the server you configure (only if you enable this feature).

## Cookies and Web Data

Web content loaded in the app's browser may set cookies or use local storage as any standard browser would. This data is managed by iOS and can be cleared through the app or device settings.

## Children's Privacy

Tapspect does not collect any data from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the revised version will be posted here with an updated date.
